                    Tracking degradation patterns across different bearing types over time, with critical thresholds marked at 7 and 15 days. This visualization shows how different bearing failures evolve, with some following gradual degradation patterns while others show more rapid deterioration near failure points.</p>

                <p class="misc-plot-description">Feature Importance (horizontal bar chart):
                    Ranking of the most influential features in our prediction model, with mid and high-frequency RMS values showing the strongest predictive power. This analysis reveals which vibration characteristics are most reliable for detecting impending bearing failures, guiding our monitoring focus.</p>

                <p class="misc-plot-description">Time till Failure vs Error (scatter plot):
                    Examining how prediction accuracy changes as bearings approach failure. The increasing spread of errors as time-to-failure increases demonstrates the greater challenge in making long-term predictions compared to short-term forecasts.</p>

                <p class="misc-plot-description">Distribution of Prediction Errors (histogram):
                    Frequency distribution of prediction errors showing most errors clustered within the first 100 days, with occasional larger deviations. This helps understand our model's typical prediction accuracy range and identifies outlier cases.</p>

                <p class="misc-plot-description">Bearing Status (bar chart):
                    Current health distribution of monitored bearings, categorizing them into Critical (0-7 days), Warning (7-14 days), and Monitor (14+ days) states. This provides an immediate overview of maintenance priorities and system health status.</p>
